"""
AudioAnalyzer Module
======================

The AudioAnalyzer performs analysis on an AudioFile instance:
  - BPM analysis (using a beat-tracking algorithm).
  - Key analysis (using a Krumhanslâ€“Schmuckler style approach).

It reports progress via a progress_callback, which (if provided) is called at the completion
of each analysis step (progress as a percentage: 50% after BPM, 100% after Key).
